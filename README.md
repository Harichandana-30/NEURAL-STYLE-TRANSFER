# NEURAL-STYLE-TRANSFER

## About the Project

This Python-based neural style transfer project blends the **content of one image** with the **artistic style of another** using a pretrained deep learning model (VGG19). The project leverages **PyTorch** and **feature representations from convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** to perform artistic transformation. It was built as a hands-on implementation of core computer vision and deep learning concepts.

This project allows users to turn photographs into artwork by mimicking the brushstrokes, color palettes, and patterns of famous styles â€” all powered by neural networks.

## Features

- Uses a **pretrained VGG19 network** for feature extraction
- Combines content from one image with style from another
- Handles image loading, normalization, and preprocessing
- Supports GPU acceleration when available
- Saves the final stylized image locally
- Displays intermediate and final outputs using matplotlib

## Why This Was Built

The project was developed to explore the intersection of **art and artificial intelligence**. Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a well-known application of deep learning that creatively demonstrates how machines can understand and reinterpret visual patterns. This implementation provides practical insights into:

- CNN feature maps
- Transfer learning using pretrained models
- Custom loss functions (content and style)
- Optimization in PyTorch

It also serves as a foundation for more advanced computer vision experiments, such as fast neural style transfer or GAN-based image synthesis.
